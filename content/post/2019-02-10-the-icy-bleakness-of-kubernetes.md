Setting up a k8s local cluster on KVM is surprisingly non-intuative.  

Just the prescription needed to fill these long winter days!

The rules are simple:  
1. command line only, using vi and tmux on a non ubuntu distro
1. solutions must scale to the enterprise level, using little to no encryption
1. use alpha code where at all possible
1. hosting to be done via a 6Mb router with intact firmware

Hints:
* rook.ceph
* metallb
* kvm

Not sure which is more sad, the hours spent reading endless screeds of condesending github issue flexing, or the hours arch.linux.ligotti spent writing them.

Well, at least he had opposable thumbs.

Enjoy!
